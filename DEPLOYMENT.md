# Deployment Guide for Vehicle Management System

## Project Structure
This is a client-side web application that uses browser's local storage for data persistence. The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html` - Login page
- `dashboard.html` - Main application dashboard
- `auth.js` - Authentication logic
- `dashboard.js` - Dashboard functionality
- `styles.css` - Global styles
- `dashboard.css` - Dashboard-specific styles

## Deployment Steps

1. Log in to your Hostinger account and access the hosting control panel.

2. Navigate to the File Manager or use FTP credentials to upload files:
   - Upload all files maintaining the same directory structure
   - Ensure file permissions are set to 644 for all files

3. Important Security Considerations:
   - The current authentication system uses client-side storage with hardcoded credentials
   - For production, implement proper server-side authentication
   - Consider adding HTTPS to secure data transmission

4. Testing After Deployment:
   - Verify all pages load correctly
   - Test login functionality
   - Confirm dashboard features work as expected
   - Check if PDF generation works
   - Ensure all styles are applied correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Implement server-side authentication
2. Add database storage for vehicle entries
3. Implement proper session management
4. Add API endpoints for data operations
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
